Level generator instructions

if prefabs set are not already in the gen prefab then set the following 

starting rooms = start (nodes folder)
paths = leftright + leftrightbottom+leftrightTop + allDirections(nodes)
filla rooms = filler (node)
end room = end (node)

treasure enemies and traps you can fill with as many of each type you want 

border = border (prefabs) this is rewquired for the pathnfinding to work can be ignored if you want to test how big the levels go
gen mehtod and difficulty -  ignore

pathchecker = A_path

the room nodes you can fill the arrays with the different room  prefabs avalible feel free to add more.

UGtilespawner just add tile to that that will make sure the tiles spawn in.


in game the controls are W,A,S,D and space to jump (jumps are infinite and there may be clipping issues with some tiles)

to view the path made with the pathfinder you can pause the game and change into scene view.  

that should be it.
